                  Every summer, the College of Engineering hosts the engineering-focused classes
                  from the UGA Summer Camp. The fabrication lab team's job was to formulate an
                  experiential curriculum around a specific engineering topic short enough to be
                  completed in a week. The curriculum was adjusted according to class level, ranging
                  from middle to high school.

              <h2 className="numbered-heading1">Pumps</h2>
              <p>
                There were two primary subjects covered: pumps and electricity. Each topic was
                covered for half of each day, and by the week's end, the concepts and projects
                merged.
              </p>
              <p>
                The pump section covered the essential inner workings (volute casing, flow rate,
                pumps don't suck liquids, etc.), and then groups of students had to develop, 3D
                print, and assemble their pumps. To design the pump body, each group followed along
                as we taught the basics of AutoCAD, and within two hours, the pump drawings were 3D
                models, ready to print. Assembly was the most challenging part since creating a
                working seal with 3D parts is nearly impossible. While rubber gaskets were used, we
                didn't anticipate that the 3D prints would &apos;sweat&apos; water under pressure.
                Each part was sprayed with a sealant that worked well enough to fix the sweating.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 className="numbered-heading1">Electricity</h2>
              <p>
                With electricity being a somewhat abstract concept, we designed a simple project
                that demonstrated electromagnetism, voltage, resistance, and current by letting
                students construct a small motor with magnets, two AA batteries, and a nail with
                coiled wire. By applying a voltage to the nail, its magnetic field spun the eight
                magnets on a 3D-printed octagon.

                This project was by the student's favorite since they were given the basics and then
                allowed to customize their motor as much as possible. For example, one student
                created a pinwheel projection that appeared animated as the attached wheel spun.

                Bringing the concepts together, the final project illustrated the Conversation of
                Energy of both mechanical to hydraulic and electrical to hydraulic energy. To do so,
                the section was divided into two groups with the same objective: pump water up a
                2-meter hose into a bucket. Whichever team filled the 5-gallon bucket first (and
                subsequently drenched the instructor underneath) won the competition.

                Both groups constructed a drive train using a rod fit into bearings that they
                screwed into a plywood base. One group focused on electrical to mechanical
                conversion and calculated the number and size of batteries necessary to power an
                electric motor attached directly to a 3D printed pump.

                The other group devised a method of converting a bike's rotational energy into
                hydraulic energy via a 3D-printed wheel attached to the drive train rod. This
                objective was more difficult than intended. The students (and instructors) struggled
                to fabricate a platform that kept the bike wheel steady and firmly placed onto the
                wheel.

                With too much pressure, the wheel melted from friction after a few revolutions, and
                too little pressure wouldn't spin the 3D print at all. Eventually, the students
                switched to a grooved wooden wheel, and with both teams ready, the final half-day
                focused on the competition.

                Comparing the power output of both, most expected the battery team to win. However,
                one of the students went insanely hard on the bike, almost winning the competition
                and nearly passing out. Each week, we tinkered with the curriculum based on student
                feedback, and overall, it was a great learning experience for all involved.
